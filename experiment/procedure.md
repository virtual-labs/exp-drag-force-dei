# Procedure

## In a Real Laboratory

1. **Measure Dimensions**  
   - Measure the dimensions of the object using a vernier caliper.

2. **Tabulate Properties**  
   - Record the object's mass, size, projected area, and the fluid properties (density and coefficient of drag) in a table.

3. **Setup Releasing Mechanism**  
   - Clamp the releasing mechanism on the stand at the desired height inside the cylinder.
   - Fix a ruler or mark graduations on the cylinder for reference.

4. **Prepare Cylinder**  
   - Ensure all openings are fully closed and airtight.
   - **For terminal velocity in fluid:**  
     Fill the cylinder with the fluid up to the electromagnet level.
   - **For free-fall in vacuum:**  
     Activate the vacuum system until the cylindrical chamber is evacuated.

5. **Position Light Gates**  
   - Clamp light gates at intervals (e.g., 20 cm or less) along the cylinder’s height.
   - Align gates so the falling object passes through each one.

6. **Secure the Object**  
   - Attach the object to the electromagnet.
   - If releasing in liquid, wet the object first to prevent air bubbles from clinging.
   - The release switch should also activate the timer (initially set to zero).

7. **Check Connections**  
   - Ensure light gates, electromagnet, data logger, computer, and power supply are properly connected.

8. **Release and Record**  
   - Press the switch to release the object.
   - Verify the computer system records:
     - Time when the object passes each light gate.
     - Time taken to pass through each gate.

9. **Note Values**  
   - Record all measured times and observations.

10. **Plot Graphs**  
    - Draw velocity–time and drag force–time graphs.

11. **Repeat Trials**  
    - Repeat the experiment multiple times to obtain mean values of measured parameters.

## In Simulation

1. **Set Parameters**  
   - Use sliders or input boxes to adjust:
     - Mass of object (*m*)
     - Size of object (*s*)
     - Projected area (*A*)
     - Coefficient of drag (*C_d*) – **only for Tube 2**
     - Fluid type – **only for Tube 2**

2. **Select Tube**  
   - **Tube 1:** Vacuum (for free-fall acceleration)  
   - **Tube 2:** Fluid (for terminal velocity)

3. **Initiate Motion**  
   - Click the **"Release"** button to start the object’s motion based on the set parameters.

4. **Observe Animation & Graphs**  
   - Watch the object fall in the animation area.
   - Note the object passing through light gates.
   - Monitor the **velocity–time graph** and **drag force–time graph** updating in real time.

5. **Record Data**  
   - Record the time (*t*) when the object passes each light gate, and the time taken to pass through the gate (*t′*).
   - Light gate positions:  
     0.4 m, 0.6 m, 0.8 m, 1.0 m, 1.2 m, 1.4 m, 1.6 m, and 1.8 m.

6. **Automatic Calculation & Plotting**  
   - Velocity and drag force are calculated automatically.
   - Graphs are displayed on the screen.

7. **Analyze Results**  
   - **For Tube 1 (Vacuum):**  
     - Expect constant acceleration (linear increase in velocity).  
     - Slope of velocity–time graph = acceleration due to gravity (*g*).  
   - **For Tube 2 (Fluid):**  
     - Velocity approaches terminal value exponentially.  
     - Velocity plateaus after initial acceleration.  
     - Drag force rises and plateaus at a constant value.

8. **Compare with Theory**  
   - Compute theoretical values using appropriate equations.
   - Tabulate discrepancies and identify possible sources of error.

9. **Download Results**  
   - Download observation tables and graphs for further analysis.

10. **Reset for New Trial**  
    - Click the **"Reset"** button to restore the simulation to its initial state.
